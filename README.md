# SFML-Vector-Operations
Tools for additional vector analysis with the sf::Vector2<T> and sf::Vector3<T> classes
  
  The vector_operations.hpp header has a load of template operations that are useful.
  The Matrix class is for doing things matrix-y on your sf::Vector2<T>s and sf::Vector3<T>s.
  
  Please use freely and any feedback would be massively appreciated!
